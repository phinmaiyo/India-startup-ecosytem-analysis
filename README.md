### Multivariate Analysis

## Hypothesis development 

✨ NULL: The location of a startup has no significant effect on the amount received from investors.

✨ ALTERNATE: The location of a startup significantly influences the amount received from investors.

Based on the Kruskal-Wallis test results, we observed a significant difference in the amount raised among different startup locations (p < 0.05). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and accept the alternative hypothesis (H1), suggesting that the location of a startup does affect the amount of funding received from investors.
